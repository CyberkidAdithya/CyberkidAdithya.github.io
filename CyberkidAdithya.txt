My favorite coding style, "<span id="k">Pythonic Everywhere</span>". <!-- sjkfhskjf -->

Hey There! I am Adithya ES, a computer science student from India.<!-- laglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglag --><p>What you are seeing now is a Command Line Version of my Personal Resume.</p>
<p>It's pretty self explanatory from the way I am presenting my Resume that I am a big fan of Linux. I love this pale green font and have been using it since my school days.</p> <!-- ksjdokhdfgdufdfkjhfkjahdfkjhafkjhakf -->
<p> I am a self-trained Python Programmer, focused on Software Application Development and Automation. My other areas of interest include Data Security, Machine Learning and Automation. I also love watching Sci-fi movies and also take inspiration from them to make my own projects. I have made some certifications and achievements in my life which you will find here.<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/adithya-es/"> LinkedIn Profile</a>.</p><!-- kjdhjhgdgldjhgdwtoiewotwotjdfkjdfffsf -->
<p>And since I make a lot of mistakes, I spend most of my day in Stackoverflow, Reddit or Github.<br><br><br> I keep my Study notes public so that people all around the world can access it and up-skill themselves. I am a fan of FOSS and I believe knowledge and software should be made accessible to all, so that people can learn from it and then we all can grow together as a community. I am attaching my notes and projects in here so that you too can access it from now on. <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16BwZxgL6LuEdKHOmD-tVFIq1KN5vh_iL?usp=sharing"> Here you go</a>.</p><!-- hsdgfhjfkdjhfkjsdhfkjdshfkjsdhfkjsdhkfjhdskjfhksdjhfkdsj -->
